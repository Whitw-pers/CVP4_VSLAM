# CVP4_VSLAM
Project 4 repository for MCEN 5228 Advanced Computer Vision at University of Colorado Boulder

Expect to need to upgrade MATLAB release to R2024b

I think it makes sense to first focus on implimentation of VSLAM, ideally on the Blackbird dataset (has camera and IMU), and if that goes quickly then we can try to impliment VISLAM on the same dataset and compare performance.
